**🍕 Python Pizza Order Program**
This is my second project created while learning Python.  
It's a simple command-line application that simulates a pizza ordering system.

🚀 What the program does

The script calculates the final bill based on the user's pizza order:

- Choose a pizza size:
  - Small (S) → $15
  - Medium (M) → $20
  - Large (L) → $25
- Optionally add:
  - Pepperoni → +$2 for Small, +$3 for Medium or Large
  - Extra cheese → +$1

After selecting the options, the total price is calculated and displayed.

📘 What I learned

This project helped me practice and understand:

- Python conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Handling user input with `input()`
- Using string methods like `.lower()` and `.upper()`
- Basic arithmetic operations and program flow

🎓 Course

This is my **second milestone project** from the  
"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"  
by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

How to run

Clone or download this repository, then run the script using Python:
